// 1. Create a variable called multiply that multiplies num1 and num2 to result in 62
let num1 = 31;
let num2 = 2;
let multiply = num1 * num2;

// 2. Create a variable called random that generates a random integer greater than 0
let random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1; 

// 3. Create a variable called mod that calculates the remainder of dividing num3 by num4, with the remainder being 4
let num3 = 14;
let num4 = 5;
let mod = num3 % num4; 

// 4. Create a variable called max that finds the highest number in a set, with the value being 20
let max = Math.max(2, 10.5, 12, 20);
